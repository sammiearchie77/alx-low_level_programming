# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

# Learning Objectives
> At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General
> What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
> What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
> What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

# Requirements

## General
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
5. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
6. You are not allowed to use global variables
7. No more than 5 functions per file
8. You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
9. You are allowed to use _putchar
10. You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
11. In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
12. The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file

# Files

1. File 0-memset.c is a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
2. File 1-memcpy.c is a function that copies memory area.
3. File 2-strchr.c is a function that locates a character in a string.
4. File 3-strspn.c is a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
5. File 4-strpbrk.c is a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
6. File 5-strstr.c is a function that locates a substring.
7. File 7-print_chessboard.c is a function that prints the chessboard.
8. File 8-print_diagsums.c is a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
9. File 9-set_string.c is a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
10. File main.h is the header file with the functions prototypes.
11. File _putchar.c is the file that contains the _putchar function.
