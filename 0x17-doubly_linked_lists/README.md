# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists

## Requirements

## General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, printf and exit
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded


## Doubly Linked Lists

0. print_dlistint.c: function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list
1. dlistint_len.c: function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list
2. add_dnodeint.c: function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list
3. add_dnodeint_end.c: function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list
4. free_dlistint.c: function that free a dlistint_t list
5. get_dnodeint.c: function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list
6. sum_dlistint.c: function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list
7. insert_dnodeint.c: function that inserts a new node at a given position
8. delete_dnodeint.c: function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list
